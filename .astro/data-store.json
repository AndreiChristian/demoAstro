It serves as the name of our organization and our software (not \"Navy software\"). To refer to specific releases from Navy, we request that you capitalize them as proper nouns (e.g., \"Navy Method\"). Please use #navy for social media tags.\n\n# Usage\n\nEnsure that there is ample space surrounding Navy's assets. Regardless of whether they are sized large or small, they should have enough breathing room. They must not appear congested or disorganized.\n\n\u003Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke=\"currentColor\" class=\"w-6 h-6 text-indigo-400\">\n  \u003Cpath stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" d=\"M9.813 15.904L9 18.75l-.813-2.846a4.5 4.5 0 00-3.09-3.09L2.25 12l2.846-.813a4.5 4.5 0 003.09-3.09L9 5.25l.813 2.846a4.5 4.5 0 003.09 3.09L15.75 12l-2.846.813a4.5 4.5 0 00-3.09 3.09zM18.259 8.715L18 9.75l-.259-1.035a3.375 3.375 0 00-2.455-2.456L14.25 6l1.036-.259a3.375 3.375 0 002.455-2.456L18 2.25l.259 1.035a3.375 3.375 0 002.456 2.456L21.75 6l-1.035.259a3.375 3.375 0 00-2.456 2.456zM16.894 20.567L16.5 21.75l-.394-1.183a2.25 2.25 0 00-1.423-1.423L13.5 18.75l1.183-.394a2.25 2.25 0 001.423-1.423l.394-1.183.394 1.183a2.25 2.25 0 001.423 1.423l1.183.394-1.183.394a2.25 2.25 0 00-1.423 1.423z\">\n\u003C/path>\n\u003C/svg>\n\nThis is a friendly reminder that the provided graphics are proprietary and protected under intellectual property laws.
